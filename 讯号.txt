多么希望
有一个地方
早晨，虫儿开始蚕食
小鸟醒来歌唱
有一条溪流
淌着光的彩
直到黑夜
直到濛濛的细雨里
会落下片片的雪

小孩子唱着自己
不成调的歌
追着纸船

我们啊，如今
脚下是土地
眼里是黄沙的影
悲伤是“过往”的重量
叹着
振奋着

低落着
笑着
一千年，一万年
欢乐声飘向何处？
泪水浸润了一方水土——
树还是年轮的树
路还是向着远方的路

谁不向抬头看看天空

莱茵河在星空底下奔流
好似星星在水里游泳
小时候
那里有彩虹的幻想
如今
才瞪大了眼睛——
这不是幻想，
分明是一颗彩虹的心
褪了色
温情的眼
在变盲

历史，政治，文艺，数学；
道德，法律，科技，发展
自打出生那刻
耳边就萦绕着这曲
最悲凉的交响乐
它使我步履蹒跚
最后不得不匍匐前行

不敢高声语——
任由咆哮在我心里发了癫
任由一盏盏alma的灯熄灭
偶尔
能看清你的脸
可我却哑了言
在这蓝色的房间
说着同一种语言
却弄不懂这个世界

海子说
“”面朝大海，春暖花开“”
写着最美的诗篇
听他们将令人作呕的话来回念！
可他是不理解的——
心死的地方，艺术开始了
良知丧尽的地方，道德开始了
自私抵达终点的地方，友谊开始了

唉
耳朵聋的时候，音乐开始了
欢笑的时候，悲伤开始了
所以
只有当我走进骨灰盒的时候，幸福才终于开始了

理，越理越乱！
人啊，自以为是的与自然割裂开的时候，无止境的愚蠢，便开始了
……

又一次
我倾听着辽阔的夜
将心儿记得的回声一一追逐
诗句跌落在心里
仿佛夜风在远方回荡

收回风筝，关上门帘
迟到的的月色啊
能否今夜轻扣她的门
聊聊
小熊座和大熊座的形状
北方的栗树上
小王子的眼睛里
那短暂得仿佛永恒的时光
……
等他们都长大了
谁
还会提起
对户篝火的温存
只剩杂物
在朦胧里隐现

我是一只迷路的麋鹿
好累好累
我是一只树上的野柿子
又酸又甜
我是黑夜里的鬼
吓得是自己
我是你手里的结
一生难逃夙愿

我是天涯海角的浪子
终点画成一个圈
我是寻常街巷的石桥
曾至
却无人知

人类为自己编织一个谎言
为了不露破绽
再也迈不出这个叫道理的圆
朋友
你可知
转身啊
就是另外一个世界

这烂诗《讯号》里讲的烂事
和蚂蚁般歪歪扭扭的象形文字
终会一年又一年覆上尘世的灰
慢慢地
慢慢地偏离了宿命的航道
没有人
没有人
再能读懂眼前这些
毁灭的讯号……

…………

两个地方
一个天空
我眼里掠过悲哀的雁群

生命若是一本书
多想来回翻读有你的章节
一样的话
一般的动作
你却是天籁的塔尔塔罗斯
骂他无情
阁楼上可憎的敲钟人
沙漏里不止的流水
系铃人说：
你前世或是一名失了舵的水手
今生的海浪里——

映出我无力的背影



How I wish
There is a place
In the morning, the worms begin to nibble
The birds wake up and sing
There is a stream
Flowing with the colors of light
Till the darkness of night
Until in the misty drizzle
Flakes of snow will fall

Children sing their own
Songs that are not in tune
Chasing paper boats

We, now
The land is under our feet
The shadow of yellow sand in our eyes
Sadness is the weight of the "past"
Sighing
Uplifting

Falling down
Laughing
A thousand years, a million years
Where does the sound of joy drift to?
Tears soak a side of water -
The tree is still the tree of the year
The road is still the same as the road to the distance

Who does not look up to the sky

The Rhine flows under the starry sky
Like stars swimming in the water
When I was a child
There was the fantasy of rainbow
Now
Now my eyes are wide open...
It's not a fantasy.
It's clearly a rainbow heart
Faded in color
The warmth of eyes
Are turning blind

History, politics, literature, mathematics.
Morality, law, technology, development
Since the moment of birth
This song has been ringing in my ears
The saddest symphony
It made me stagger
And finally I have to crawl

I dare not speak aloud...
Letting the roar of my heart go mad
Let an alma's light go out
Occasionally
I can see your face
But I am speechless
In this blue room
Speaking the same language
But I can't understand the world

Haizi said
"Facing the sea, flowers bloom in spring""
Writing the most beautiful poems
Listening to them read the sickening words back and forth!
But he is incomprehensible -
Where the heart dies, art begins
Where conscience is lost, morality begins
Where selfishness reaches its end, friendship begins

Alas!
Where music begins when the ears are deaf
When laughter begins, sorrow begins
So
Only when I walk into the urn, does happiness finally begin

The more you reason, the more confusing it becomes!
O man, the endless folly that begins when you think you are cut off from nature
......

Once again
I listened to the vast night
Chasing the echoes that my heart remembers one by one
The verses fall in my heart
As if the night wind echoes in the distance

Retract the kite and close the curtain
The late moonlight
Can you lightly button her door tonight
Let's talk about
The shape of Ursa Minor and Ursa Major
In the chestnut tree in the north
In the eyes of the little prince
The time that was so short that it seemed like an eternity
......
When they all grow up
Who
Will still talk about
The warmth of a campfire
Only miscellaneous things remain
Hidden in the haze

I am a lost moose
So tired, so tired
I'm a wild persimmon on a tree
Sour and sweet
I'm a ghost in the night
Scared of myself
I am the knot in your hand
A lifetime of long-cherished wishes

I'm the prodigal son at the end of the earth
The end point is drawn as a circle
I am a stone bridge in an ordinary street
Once there
But no one knows

Man weaves a lie for himself
In order not to reveal the flaw
Never again can we step into this circle called truth
Friend
Do you know
Turn around
is another world

The bad things in this bad poem "The Signal
And ant-like twisted hieroglyphics
will be covered with the dust of the world year after year
Slowly
Slowly deviating from the course of destiny
No one
No one
can read these signs of destruction
Signs of destruction ......

............

Two places
One sky
My eyes pass by the sad geese

If life were a book
I would like to read the chapters with you in them
The same words
The same movements
You are the heavenly Tartarus
Calling him heartless
The loathsome bell-ringer in the attic
The flowing water that does not stop in the hourglass
The bell-ringer said.
You were either a sailor who lost his helm in a past life
In the waves of this life...

Reflects my feeble back
