静静的夜
如何坦诚地看着月
悄悄的说
千万回忆漫过心头
-----------
看潮落了
回忆跌落
剩下我和我的难过

不能眠
时针仍不停的旋
不能哭
没有理由控诉美好的明天
几次拾起斑驳的笔
几次为了什么思绪万千
当理想的旗帜
随着前行更远
当信仰的承诺
欺骗岁月不见
我需要一杯酒
来吞下无声的哽咽

撕碎了
信笺里的枫叶
漂浮在
八月不热的夏天
往事随风
在回忆里周旋
旧情随你
走进漫漫的长夜

一瓶安眠的药
摔碎滴答的时间
一首曾经最爱的音乐
唱着再也找不回的从前
人来，人往
人来，人忘
深深的脚印被无情的风带走了
这原始的文字
到底还藏着多少虚伪与自私
我也累了
放下笔
呼呼的睡了

Silent Night
How to look frankly at the moon
Whispering
A million memories roam through my heart
-----------
Watching the tide go down
Memories fall
Leaving me and my sadness

Can't sleep
The clock hand still keeps spinning
Can't cry
No reason to complain about a better tomorrow
How many times have I picked up the drab pen
Several times for what thoughts
When the ideal flag
With the forward march farther
When the promise of faith
Deceive the years are gone
I need a glass of wine
To swallow the silent choking

Torn up
The maple leaves in the letterhead
Floating in
The summer of August is not hot
Past events follow the wind
Swirling in the memories
Old feelings follow you
Into the long night

A bottle of sleeping pills
Crushing the ticking time
A piece of music that I used to love the most
Singing about the past that can never be recovered
People come and people go
People come and people forget
The deep footprints are carried away by the relentless wind
The original words
How much hypocrisy and selfishness is still hidden
I am also tired
Put down the pen
I fell asleep
