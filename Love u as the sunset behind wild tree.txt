我爱你
如野树后的夕阳
为你冒险
每个细节
都是不曾安眠的倔强

我爱你
是夕阳后深深长夜
在时空中错乱
在梦境里弥散
却不懂
你炽热如火的浪漫

我爱你
如长夜后的寂静
是一直凝望的城堡
等你
等你走近
去看，去触，去听

我爱你
是雨里的背影
在黄昏里眺望
是不朽的童话
在废墟里生长

是烛光里的残页
是述不尽的乐章
待你走后
every moment becomes
the reason
for, our eternal song


english version：
I love you
Like the sunset behind the wild trees
Adventuring for you
Every detail
The stubbornness that never sleeps

I love you
Is the long night after the sunset
In time and space
In the dream world
But I don't understand
Your hot, fiery romance

I love you
Like the silence after a long night
It's a castle that I've been gazing at
Waiting for you
Waiting for you to come closer
To see, to touch, to hear

I love you
It is the back in the rain
Looking out in the dusk
It's an immortal fairy tale
Growing in the ruins

It's a page in the candlelight
It's the endless music
After you are gone
Every moment becomes
the reason
for, our eternal song
