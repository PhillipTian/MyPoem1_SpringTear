望眼欲穿
秋水也泛起一片波澜
穿过秋水
那声晚安
又被岁月阻拦
它穿过了人群
却穿不过有你的灯火阑珊

望眼欲穿
你就站在
斜阳傍晚
曾经想过回头
如今
只听见声声慢
听见你说
好聚
也好散

这人生
未免太短
这夕阳下
城市的脉搏
涌动着不安

晚风里
你笑月亮只剩一半
从此我的世界
没了你的陪伴
                       2021.10.02 凌晨
                       
                       
I'm looking forward to see what's in store for me
The autumn water is also rippling
Through the autumn water
That good night
It was stopped again by the years
It passed through the crowd
But it can't pass through the lights of you

Looking through the eyes
You're standing there
In the sunset evening
Once I thought of turning back
Now
I only hear the sound of slowing down
Hearing you say
It's good to be together
And goodbye

This life
Is too short
In this sunset
The pulse of the city
Surge of uneasiness

In the evening breeze
You laugh at the moon only half left
From now on my world
Without your company
                       2021.10.02 Early morning
