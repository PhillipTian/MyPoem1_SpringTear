找你，你不在
可距离和冷酷
实在不是我的做派
小女孩
没有看到的风景
我想为你拍下来

不论 这四季淘洗青春
风霜或者严寒
我心疼，当你不安
你的事，与我有关

多难，说的一尘不染
人生，过的何其短暂
烟花在天空
未来即刻消散

星河此刻
只为我们流转

有时我伸手想抓住
时光仿佛流的
很慢，很慢
有时我开口却不知所言
我做你的弟弟
很晚，很晚
不知道下一个莱茵春天
你是否为我还在
下一次相遇
发生在沧海彼岸

夜的温婉
你房前的小灯一盏
想听你侃侃而谈
想听你偶尔感叹
我只有资格
在月下期待

平平淡淡
空空泛泛
孤单的夜
悄悄企盼
灯火阑珊
行人二三

星星发呆
渔人听海
你不明白
站在门外


Looking for you, you're not there
But distance and coldness
It's just not my style
Little girl
The scenery I didn't see
I want to take pictures of you

No matter the seasons wash away youth
The wind and frost or the cold
My heart aches, when you are restless
Your business, it's about me

How hard it is to say it's spotless
Life, how short it is to live
Fireworks in the sky
The future dissipates instantly

The river of stars at this moment
Flowing only for us

Sometimes I reach out and try to catch
Time seems to flow
Slowly, very slowly
Sometimes I open my mouth but I don't know what to say
I'll be your brother
It's late, it's late
I don't know if the next Rheinland spring
Are you still there for me
The next time we meet
Happens on the other side of the sea

The warmth of the night
A small lamp in front of your room
I want to listen to you talk so eloquently
I want to hear you sigh occasionally
I am only qualified
Expecting under the moon

Plain and uneventful
Empty and vague
Lonely night
I quietly hope
The lights go down
Two or three pedestrians

Starry and dull
Fisherman listening to the sea
You don't understand
Standing outside the door
