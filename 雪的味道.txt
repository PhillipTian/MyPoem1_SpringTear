"听说夕阳融化的雪，会变成糖"

一

那也是一个冬夜
小人儿看着掌心的雪
"你也听说过，那个秘密?"

那也是一个雨夜
好像所有的浪漫藏在你的眼睛
从此
我开始在雾都等一个奇迹

在那不下雪的四季
倒数着和你一起翻页的日历
后来，后来你不再提及
后来，我们都好像忘记
-------
转眼间的我们
消失在匆匆的人群

二

"世间的最好浪漫
大抵是把至死不渝写在眼睛..."

游人来了，又走了
教堂翻修了三次
在午夜将近的布拉格广场
雕像旁有个小男孩
独自守在每一个夕阳

三

如果童话发生会遗憾
没有发生是否又悲伤?------2021

曾同你许诺过的愿望
或只是属于另一个时空的梦想
城堡还在
只是没人在意身后的月光
漫步在寒冬的布拉格广场
穿过零点午夜将近的疯狂
在来不及告别的深冬
又想起你四月的脸庞
镜头里聚焦的人群
无异于遥远的星光

无数次
我曾等到夕阳下的雪
可无数次
我又想起你期待的目光
枫,夕阳融化的雪
不会变成糖
如果一切既定的事实
我可以假装幻象
会破灭的，却是我唯一生的信仰

教父敲响了大钟
万家灯火,好像人间的夕阳
只剩一个有家可归的浪子
像孤魂在世间游荡


"I heard that snow that melts at sunset turns into sugar"

One

It was also a winter night
The little man looked at the snow in his palm
"You've heard that secret, too?"

It was also a rainy night
As if all the romance was hidden in your eyes
Since then
I started to wait for a miracle in the foggy city

In those seasons when it doesn't snow
Counting down the calendar that turns pages with you
Later, later you stopped talking about it
Later, we all seemed to forget
-------
In the blink of an eye, we
Disappear in the rush of the crowd

Two

"The best romance in the world
is to write in your eyes..."

Tourists come and go
The church has been renovated three times
In Prague Square, near midnight
There is a little boy by the statue
Alone at every sunset

Three

If fairy tales happen, is it a pity
Is it sad if it doesn't happen? ------2021

The wish I promised you
Or just a dream that belongs to another time and space
The castle is still there
Only no one cares about the moonlight behind
Strolling through Prague Square in the winter
Through the madness of midnight near zero
In the dead of winter when it's too late to say goodbye
Remembering your April face again
The crowd in the camera's focus
No different from the distant starlight

Countless times
I have waited for the snow at sunset
But countless times
I remember your expectant gaze again
Maple, the snow melted by the sunset
Won't turn into sugar
If all the established facts
I can pretend to be an illusion
What will break is my only living faith

The Godfather rang the bell
All the lights are on, like the sunset on earth
Only a prodigal son with a home to return to
Like a lonely soul wandering in the world
